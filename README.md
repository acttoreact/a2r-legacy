Framework heart. Everything will be here.

### Files Structure

### Initialization

Single command initialization.

### Developing with A2R

Single command for developing.

### API Runtime Transpiler

Changes on API methods and data model are compiled and refreshed on runtime.

### Integrated and updated libraries

Forget about updating all your dependencies on every project. You just need to update A2R and framework takes care.

### Sockets

### Pages

### Etc
