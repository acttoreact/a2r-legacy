## A2R Framework

The *isomorphic* and *reactive* **framework** that scales.

## Core

Framework heart. Everything will be here.

### Files Structure

A [brief explanation about the files structure](../docs/core/coreFilesStructure.md) so you know where to look when you're looking for something in particular.

### Initialization

Single command initialization.

### Developing with A2R

Single run command.

### API Runtime Transpiler

Changes on API methods and data model are compiled and refreshed on runtime.

### Integrated and updated libraries

Forget about updating all your dependencies on every project. You just need to update A2R and framework takes care.
